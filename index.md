# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Everett - or Ev for short. I'm a digital artist, musician, programmer, and storyteller. 

You can find my visual work over in the [Gallery](gallery.md). My music work can be found over on [Bandcamp](aurorapalace.bandcamp.com). I also worked on a voxel shooter game - [Project Axios](https://zakamitesro.github.io/projAxios-testBuild/). 

You can contact me at evhuynh28@gmail.com.
